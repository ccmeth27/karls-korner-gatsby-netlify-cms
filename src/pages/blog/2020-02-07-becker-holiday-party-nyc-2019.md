I was skeptical when the party started at with a painting class in Muse down in Tribeca especially since my painting ability is basically nil. The night turned out pretty good including our holiday meal at Tutto Il Giorno in Tribeca. I had the Bronzino poached in a tomato, celery and olive oil broth, spinach which was very good. Below is my painting and some photos of our food and the event.
