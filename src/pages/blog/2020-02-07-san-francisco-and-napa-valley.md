Although our trip started with a shaky brownout in Napa (no fires thank God) we made the best of it by having some great Cioppino at Fog Harbor restaurant on the Wharf. The Dungeness crab and sauce made this one of my favorite meals. Our meals at Catch and Delfina were very good and the toughest part about eating in San Francisco was to pick just three restaurants out of the many excellent one’s. The tours we took of the city and Alcatraz were really interesting and made the trip great. Don’t leave San Francisco without trying the Irish whiskey at Buena Vista; quite the experience. We caught a break since the air show was in town for the week and the jets really put on a show
